Atomic radial potentials for 1 <= Z <= 102 at non-relativistic (nr)
and scalar-relativistic (sr) levels of theory for the LDA, "correct
asymptotic potential" (CAP), and Chachiyo (CHA) exchange functionals,
generated from atomic GPAW calculations with spin-unrestricted
i.e. spin-polarized orbitals, and obtained by averaging the potential
over the two spin channels. Because some atomic potentials (e.g. Li)
had significant numerical noise far away from the nucleus, the
potentials have been smoothed by exponential fitting in the interval
from 8 au to 50 au.
